    <h1>Welcome to DK OS 🖥️🖥️🖥️🖥️🖥️🖥️</h1>
    <p>This is my personal website designed as a desktop environment, showcasing my frontend skills and serving as my portfolio. 🎨 Explore various apps, check out my projects, and experience the creativity! 🌟 . This project is inspired by some similar websites I have seen web core aesthetics in things like <a href="https://lmirman.itch.io/somnium"> Somnium </a>, retro computers like the old macs.</p>

      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <p>Navigate through the desktop icons, open new windows, discover applications like a calculator and notepad, and enjoy games—all programmed by me! Simply click on the icons to launch these interactive experiences. I worked hard on the drag and drop system and thanks to my game dev experience set up some collision where needed. It's not super responsive; also, feel free to check out my <a href='./index copy.html' target='_blank'>old website</a>.</p>
