Welcome to **[David Kozdra's Portfolio](https://davidkozdra.com)**, an interactive front-end experience designed to emulate the look and feel of a desktop environment (DE). This portfolio serves as a showcase of my skills as a front-end developer, blending modern web technologies with my passion for classic operating systems and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) from past computing eras.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is designed to resemble a desktop environment, complete with:
- **Interactive windows**: Visitors can navigate between sections of the site using windowed applications, just like a desktop.
- **Icon-based desktop**: Projects and tools can be launched from desktop icons, similar to old operating systems.
- **Taskbar and System Tray**: Mimicking a fully functional operating system, the portfolio includes a taskbar, system tray, and status indicators like time, Wi-Fi, and notifications.

## Purpose

This project is a personal exploration of two things:
1. **Front-End Web Development**: Demonstrating my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on building intuitive and responsive UIs.
2. **Nostalgia for Classic Desktop Environments**: Inspired by older operating systems such as Windows 98, classic Mac OS, and Linux desktop environments, the site pays homage to the simplicity and usability of these vintage systems.

## Features

- **Desktop Simulation**: A simulated desktop environment where visitors can open "apps" (pages) like **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Resume**.
- **Calculator & Notes**: Small utility applications you would typically find on a traditional desktop.
- **System Settings**: A settings panel for customizing the experience, mirroring a control panel from classic operating systems.
- **Taskbar with System Information**: A fully functional taskbar showing the current time and providing quick access to key sections of the site.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: The layout and styling of the entire site are built using clean and accessible markup.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality like opening windows, switching between sections, and handling the taskbar interactions are powered by vanilla JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, ensuring that it works smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.
  
## Why Desktop Environments?

My fascination with old desktop environments stems from their simplicity, functionality, and aesthetic appeal. I believe that many of these concepts can still serve as a basis for clean, user-friendly web design today. By blending the nostalgic feel of these operating systems with modern web technology, I aimed to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
